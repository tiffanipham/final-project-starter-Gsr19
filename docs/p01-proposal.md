|Abstract | Our main question is: What are the most common crimes that occur in Los Angeles, California, and why? This question is important because the types of crimes vary, and knowing what kind of crimes are more prominent in the city, it will help people address the issue and to keep the crimes limited. To address the question, we will look into the Los Angeles crime data, which includes several different factors, such as, dates and times occurred, area of occurrence, and we plan to not only look at the occurrences but to also explore why these crimes are happening. |
